Please contact Rimmy if you'd like to make alterations to these scripts or release derivatives. If the mod is missing a feature you require, please contact Rimmy#0001 preferably on discord ( discord.gg/rimmy ) and assuming the feature is possible I will attempt to merge it into Dynamic AI Minefields. I'd like to avoid too many derivative versions in favour of making the core version feature more choice in how it operates.
